## Usage
I'm using Docker to run a dev version off the PWA.
To start using this PWA download the latest version of Docker.
Then run the build_docker.sh file and you are off to the races.

Open Kitematic to see the webpack build progress.

Then open up your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:3000/
That's it. Easy right?
